            <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
In my role as Overseas Financial Manager for Nature Home, I was responsible for the financial health of six entities across North America and Asia. During the economic volatility of 2023, a key U.S.-based supplier showed signs of severe liquidity strain, prompting an internal risk review. My task was to move beyond qualitative assessment and provide a data-driven evaluation of the potential for supplier insolvency and its impact on our operations.
</p>

<h4>Research Area and Method</h4>
<p>
This analysis sits at the intersection of corporate finance and empirical risk assessment.
</p>

<p>My methodology was two-fold:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Financial Ratio Analysis &amp; Benchmarking:</b> I calculated key financial ratios (including standard ratios proxies) for the supplier based on their available public data and our internal payment history. I then benchmarked these against industry aggregates to contextualize its deteriorating position.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Scenario Modeling and Stress Testing in Python:</b> To quantify the risk, I used Python to build a dynamic financial scenario model. This model simulated the supplier's cash flow under various stress conditions (e.g., a drop in sales, a rise in input costs) to estimate its higher default risk over the following 12 months. This approach provided a more nuanced, forward-looking view than static ratio analysis alone.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Main Results and Conclusion</h4>
<p>
The scenario model indicated a high probability of financial distress, which led us to diversify our supply chain and tighten credit terms. While the supplier ultimately secured emergency financing and avoided bankruptcy, the exercise was critical. It validated the model as an effective early-warning system and led to the development of a formalized vendor risk dashboard.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, this experience highlighted a fundamental question: how do the institutional mechanisms of bankruptcy (e.g., professional fees, trustee incentives) ultimately influence which firms survive, and at what cost to creditors?

            <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
Upon joining Singapore Heng Sheng Development Group to oversee finance for a $2.5 billion resort project, I encountered a fragmented financial ecosystem. Twenty-five entities were using a combination of legacy systems and manual spreadsheets, leading to delays in consolidation, data inconsistencies, and impaired forecasting. Leading the group-wide implementation of the SAP ERP system was a strategic initiative to redesign our core financial infrastructure.
</p>

<h4>Research Area and Method</h4>
<p>
This project was a rigorous process improvement and performance evaluation initiative. To measure the impact of the new system, I established a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and tracked them for three months before and after the SAP go-live date, creating a clear before-and-after comparison.</p>

<p>The outcome variables I tracked included:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Time to Close:</b> The number of days required to complete monthly financial consolidation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Forecasting Accuracy:</b> The percentage deviation of quarterly revenue forecasts from actuals.
  </li>
   <li>
    <b>Process Efficiency:</b> The number of manual journal entries required for inter-company reconciliations.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Main Results and Conclusion</h4>
<p>
The implementation yielded significant and measurable improvements, directly contributing to my achievement of reducing operating costs by 12% at Nature Home. The monthly financial closing cycle was reduced. Forecasting accuracy improved, as real-time data access allowed for more dynamic model adjustments. Most tellingly, manual interventions for inter-company reconciliations fell significantly.
</p>

<p>
This project solidified my belief that the architecture of information systems is a critical determinant of organizational efficiency and control quality. </p>
