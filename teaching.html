      <p>I learned the critical importance of financial infrastructure not from a textbook, but while implementing a new consolidation system across our international entities. The previous process of manually reconciling inter-company transactions across different accounting standards and time zones was fraught with delays and errors, obscuring a clear view of our consolidated leverage. Spearheading the OneStream implementation gave me a firsthand appreciation for how the architecture of financial systems directly shapes the quality of strategic decisions. This experience is what draws me to Professor Antill's work on market and institutional design. I am convinced that the Predoctoral Research Associate position in your team offers the suitable environment to transition from applying financial systems to fundamentally studying their fundamental efficiency. </p>
      <p>At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I immersed myself in the analytical rigor of finance through courses such as Advanced Corporate Finance, Financial Markets, and Mergers & Acquisitions. These were not merely theoretical exercises; they provided the scaffolding for understanding the structural dynamics of firm behavior under duress. In FIN 418: Financial Modeling, I completed coursework on LBO and bankruptcy modeling. My capstone project, completed under the UIUC Financial Management Program, involved simulating bankruptcy scenarios for a mid-sized manufacturing firm. Using historical data from SEC filings, I estimated recovery rates under Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 and evaluated the impact of judicial assignment on outcomes.</p>
      <p>As Overseas Financial Manager for Nature Home, I was responsible for financial consolidation across six entities spanning the U.S., Canada, and China. One of my most formative projects involved leading the post-acquisition integration of a distressed supplier. The target was facing Chapter 11, and I collaborated with Deloitte's audit team to assess the viability of reorganization versus liquidation. We modeled creditor recovery under multiple scenarios, weighing the costs of professional fees against the potential for operational turnaround. This experience gave me insight into the tensions that your paper "Are Bankruptcy Professional Fees Excessively High?" seeks to resolve.</p>
      <p>At Singapore Heng Sheng Development Group, I managed financial planning for a $2.5 billion resort project, which is a complex capital structure involving mezzanine financing, secured debt, and inter-creditor agreements. I observed how covenant design and priority erosion influenced restructuring outcomes, themes directly relevant to your working paper, "Creditor-on-Creditor Violence and Secured Debt Dynamics."</p>
      <p>I am fluent in a suite of analytical tools essential for empirical finance research. I have used Python to build predictive models for loan default, R for statistical analysis of audit samples, and Power BI to visualize financial health indicators for board reporting. In my current role, I implemented OneStream for group-wide forecasting, shortening reporting cycle markedly and improving the accuracy of cash flow projections. I am also experienced in data curation, for example, extracting data from SEC filings to cleaning loan-level datasets. I will be happy to apply these skills to support your work on bankruptcy forum shopping or litigation financing.</p>
      <p>Your NBER working paper on healthcare provider bankruptcies and the secured-debt overhang paper speak to both the medical and credit-supply channels I observed when modeling inter-credior agreements at Heng Sheng.The finding that bankruptcies exacerbate staff turnover and reduce care quality underscores the human cost of financial distress. I am equally intrigued by your ongoing work on patent litigation finance, where litigation finance shapes innovation incentives. I faced similar issue when auditing IP-backed loans.</p>
      <p>The Predoctoral Research Associate position at HBS represents more than a temporary appointment. I take it is as an apprenticeship in rigorous scholarship. I am drawn to the School's culture of collaboration, its emphasis on field engagement, and the opportunity to learn from faculty who shape both academic and practitioner discourse. I am also willing to support the development of teaching cases, such as your recent work on Silicon Valley Bank, which blends narrative insight with technical depth. Besides, I am glad to assist with Chinese-language court documents if needed. </p>
